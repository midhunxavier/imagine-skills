# Publication chart styling

## Typography

- Titles: ~14–18px for screen-sized figures; scale down for mm-sized exports if needed.
- Axis labels: ~11–12px.
- Tick labels: ~10–11px.

Always verify readability at the final embedded size in your manuscript PDF.

## Strokes and markers

- Use consistent stroke widths across all charts in a paper.
- Avoid ultra-thin strokes that vanish when downsampled in PDFs.
- Markers: use small circles (r ~3–4px) and keep them consistent across panels.

## Color

- Use colorblind-safe palettes and ensure grayscale legibility.
- When colors are close, add line dashes or different marker shapes.

## Density

- Avoid clutter: fewer ticks, fewer gridlines, and fewer legend entries is usually better.
- Use whitespace intentionally (margins and spacing).
