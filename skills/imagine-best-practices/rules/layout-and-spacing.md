# Layout and spacing

## Alignment

- Align boxes to a shared left edge or centerline.
- Keep horizontal gaps constant (e.g., 60–80px).
- Keep vertical rhythm consistent between title, subtitle, and content.

## Text baseline consistency

- Use a consistent y position for titles and subtitles across figures.
- Prefer `dominantBaseline="middle"` for vertically centered labels.

## Avoid clipping

- Add enough padding from the edges for labels and arrowheads.
- If you see clipping on export, increase margins or move content inward.
