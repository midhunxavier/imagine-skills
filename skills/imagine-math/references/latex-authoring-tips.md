# LaTeX authoring tips for figures

- Keep equations short; break long expressions into multiple lines when possible.
- Use `\\mathrm{}` for roman text in math mode (units, operators).
- Prefer explicit parentheses and spacing around operators for readability.
- If you rely on macros, keep them minimal and test render output early.
