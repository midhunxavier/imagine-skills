# Multi-panel guidelines

## Panel labeling

- Use short panel labels (a), b), c)…) near the top-left of each panel.
- Keep label font weight slightly heavier than axis text.

## Shared structure

- Keep margins consistent across panels so plots align visually.
- If panels share units/ranges, use a shared axis range for easy comparison.

## Legends

- Prefer a shared legend for the whole figure to reduce repetition.
- If each panel needs a legend, keep it in the same corner consistently.

## Spacing

- Ensure enough whitespace between panels to prevent labels from colliding.
- Avoid overly thick borders; subtle separators are usually sufficient.
