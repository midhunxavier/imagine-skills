# imagine-layout

Use this skill to compose multi-panel scientific figures in Imagine.

## Workflow

1. Start from `imagine-scaffold` kind `layout-multi-panel`.
2. Decide rows/cols and panel spacing first (match journal layout constraints).
3. Keep axes and typography consistent across panels.
4. Use panel labels (a), b), c)…) in consistent positions.
